# Third-party notices

The skill's own code (`SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/template.html`,
`assets/app.js`, `assets/app.css`, `examples/`, `evals/`) is distributed under the
repository MIT license. The files in `assets/vendor/` are unmodified copies of the
packages below, taken from their npm tarballs on 2026-10-08. They are inlined into
every generated dashboard, so the build script embeds this whole file in each
generated HTML file as a comment at the top. Keep it free of HTML comment delimiters;
the build fails if it contains them.

To update a library, download the new npm tarball, copy the same paths, update the
table and the hashes, and rebuild the examples to check that nothing broke.
