description: Manage stacked PR branches - split large changes into small, reviewable PRs, update branches after base merge, and cascade changes downstream. Triggers when working with chained/dependent PRs or when a change needs to be split into multiple PRs.

# Stacked PRs Branch Management

## Overview
This skill helps manage a chain of dependent PRs (stacked PRs) where each PR builds on the previous one.

## When to Use

- Splitting a large change into multiple small PRs
- Updating downstream branches after a PR in the chain is merged
- Syncing the chain with new commits on main
- Creating a new PR that depends on an unmerged PR

## Decision: Independent PR vs. Stacked PR

| Scenario | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| Change is self-contained, no dependency on unmerged work | **Independent PR** — branch from `main` |
| Change builds on top of an unmerged PR | **Stacked PR** — branch from the parent PR branch |
| Large change that can be split into independent pieces | **Multiple independent PRs** from `main` |
| Large change where pieces depend on each other sequentially | **Stacked PRs** — chain branches |

## Branch Chain Pattern
```
main
  └── pr1-branch (base: main)
        └── pr2-branch (base: pr1-branch)
              └── pr3-branch (base: pr2-branch)
```

## Commands

### 1. Update Branches After PR Merge

When a PR in the chain is squash-merged to main:

**Key Strategy - Avoid Conflict Hell:**
1. Merge main into the **original merged branch** first (locally)
2. Then cascade merge through downstream branches
3. This works because downstream branches already know how to merge from their parent

**Steps:**
1. `git fetch origin main`
2. `git checkout {merged-branch}`
3. `git merge origin/main -m "Merge main into {merged-branch}"`
4. For each downstream branch in order:
   - `git checkout {downstream-branch}`
   - `git merge {parent-branch} -m "Merge {parent-branch} into {downstream-branch}"`
   - Run tests/checks relevant to the PR (e.g., `make check-lint`, `make test`)
   - If new errors from merged files, fix them and commit
   - `git push origin {downstream-branch}`

### 2. Update Branches After Main Updated

When main has new commits unrelated to the PR chain:

1. `git fetch origin main`
2. Merge main into the first branch in chain
3. Cascade merge through all downstream branches
4. Push each branch

### 3. Split Large Change into Multiple PRs

Follow [Google's Small CLs Guide](references/small-cls.md) principles:

- ~100 lines per PR is reasonable, ~1000 is too large
- Each PR should be "one self-contained change"
- Keep refactoring separate from features/bug fixes
- System must work after each PR merges

**Splitting strategies:**
- By type: formatting -> lint fixes -> manual fixes
- By feature: independent full-stack features separately
- By files: group by reviewer expertise

**Workflow:**
1. Identify logical groupings
2. Create branches in sequence, each based on the previous
3. Create PRs with appropriate base branches
4. Use `gh pr create --base {parent-branch}` for each

## Example Workflow

```bash
# After pr1-branch is merged to main
git fetch origin
git checkout pr1-branch
git merge origin/main -m "Merge main into pr1-branch"

# Cascade to pr2
git checkout pr2-branch
git merge pr1-branch -m "Merge pr1-branch into pr2-branch"
git push origin pr2-branch

# Cascade to pr3
git checkout pr3-branch
git merge pr2-branch -m "Merge pr2-branch into pr3-branch"
git push origin pr3-branch
```

## Verify and Fix After Merge

After merging, verify each branch still passes its checks:

1. **Run relevant checks** for the PR's purpose:
   - Lint PRs: `make check-lint` or `uv run ruff check .`
   - Format PRs: `make fmt` or `uv run ruff format .`
   - Test PRs: `make test` or `uv run pytest`

2. **If new errors appear** from merged files:
   - Fix them on the appropriate branch (usually the one responsible for that type of fix)
   - Commit fixes: `git commit -m "Fix errors from merged files"`
   - Push and cascade downstream

3. **Update documentation** if error counts changed (e.g., in progress tracking docs)

## Tips

- Always use merge (not rebase) to keep history simple
- Resolve conflicts at each level before moving downstream
- Push after each successful merge
- Check PR diff after updates to ensure correctness
- Run checks on each branch to catch new errors early
